    <p>These terms and conditions create a contract between you and Apple (the “Agreement”). Please read the Agreement carefully. To confirm your understanding and acceptance of the Agreement, click I Commit.” </p>

    <h2>A. INTRODUCTION TO OUR SERVICES</h2>

    <p>This Agreement governs your use of Apple’s services (“Services”), through which you can buy, get, license, rent or subscribe to content, apps (“Apps”), and other in-app services (collectively, “Content”). Content may be offered through the Services by Apple or a third party. Our Services are available for your use in your country of residence (“Home Country”). To use our Services, you need compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required) and Internet access (fees may apply). Our Services’ performance may be affected by these factors.</p>

    <h2>B. USING OUR SERVICES</h2>


    <h3>PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUNDS</h3>

    <p>You can acquire Content on our Services for free or for a charge, either of which is referred to as a “Transaction.” Each Transaction is an electronic contract between you and Apple, and/or you and the entity providing the Content on our Services. However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd. and you acquire an App or a book, Apple Distribution International Ltd. is the merchant of record; this means that you acquire the Content from Apple Distribution International Ltd., and it is licensed by the App Provider (as defined below) or book publisher. When you make your first Transaction, we will ask you to choose how frequently we should ask for your password for future Transactions. If you enable Touch ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions with your fingerprint, and if you enable Face ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions using facial recognition. Manage your password settings at any time by following these instructions: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204030. Apple will charge your selected payment method (such as your credit card, debit card, gift card/code, or other method available in your Home Country) for any paid Transactions, including any applicable taxes. If you have also added it to your Apple Wallet, Apple may charge your selected payment method in Apple Wallet using Apple Pay. If we cannot charge your selected payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method again as you may update your payment method information. If you pre-order Content, you will be charged when the Content is delivered to you (unless you cancel prior to the Content’s availability). In accordance with local law, Apple may update information regarding your selected payment method if provided such information by your financial institution. For details about how Transactions are billed, please visit http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5582. All Transactions are final. Content prices may change at any time. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of Content, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement of the Content or refund of the price paid, as determined by Apple. From time to time, Apple may refuse a refund request if we find evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other manipulative behavior that entitles Apple to a corresponding counterclaim. Terms related to Store Credit and gift cards/codes are available here: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/giftcards/. </p>


    <h3>APPLE ID</h3>

    <p>Using our Services and accessing your Content may require an Apple ID. An Apple ID is the account you use across Apple’s ecosystem.

Please contact Apple if you suspect that your Apple ID has been compromised.</p>

    <p>You must be age 13 (or equivalent minimum age in your Home Country, as set forth in the registration process) to create an Apple ID and use our Services. Apple IDs for persons under this age can be created by a parent or legal guardian using Family Sharing or by an approved educational institution.</p>

Certain Services and Content available to you in your Home Country may not be available to you when traveling outside of your Home Country.</p>

    <h3>NON-APPLE USERS</h3>

    <p>https://www.tomsguide.com/us/android-is-better-than-iphone,news-21296.html1.</p> 

    <p> Better values
If  you want an iPhone, you have eight choices: the $349 iPhone SE, the $449 iPhone 6s, the $549 iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 7, the $669 iPhone 7 Plus, the $699 iPhone 8, the $799 iPhone 8 Plus, and the $999 iPhone X. While the 4-inch iPhone SE may sound like a bargain in comparison to its big brothers, you can find a really great Android phone that sells for less than $349 and comes with a much bigger screen.There are more than half a dozen good Android phones that cost less than $250. You can get a solid handset like the Moto G5 Plus — which has a 5.2-inch, 1080p display; a snappy Snapdragon 625 CPU; and a good 12-MP camera — for just $239. Available on MetroPCS, the $130 ZTE Blade Z Max has a 6-inch, full-HD display and lasts more than 11 hours on a charge.</p>

    <h2>2. 3.5mm headphone jacks</h2>

    <p>All phones since the iPhone 7 lack the 3.5mm audio jack that lets you connect a pair of standard headphones. If you want to listen to music on your Apple handset, you'll have to use a dongle, connect a pair of Bluetooth headphones or buy a wired set that uses the company's proprietary Lightning connector.However, most of the world's headphones — ranging from the $3 pair you get at Walgreens to the $300 set of Bose QuietComforts you got for your birthday — still use the 3.5mm connector. With the exception of the Moto Z and Google Pixel / Pixel 2, most Android phones still have this popular port, including all of the hottest handsets from Samsung, LG and OnePlus..</p>

    <p>
    3. USB Type-C charging ports with fast charging
If you want to charge an iPhone or connect it to your computer for any reason, you'll need a cable with Apple's proprietary Lightning port. Unfortunately, other than iPhones and iPads, no devices charge over Lightning, so you can't share the same set of cables with your other gear. This is ironic, because Apple's MacBooks charge via USB-C.</p>

    <p>
    Today, most new Android phones use a USB Type-C port for charging, which means that they can access an extremely broad universe of ports and peripherals, from universal chargers to docking stations. In addition, USB-C enables fast wired charging on most newer Android phones. With the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X, charging fast with a wire means buying another 29-watt or higher power brick plus a USB-C-to-Lightning cable.</p>

    <p>
   4. Customization, widgets and skins
Like a father in a 1950s sitcom, Apple thinks it knows what's best for you, no matter what you need or want, so it locks down the UI and offers fewer customizations than Google does. You're limited to a few select widgets. But with Android, you can choose from thousands of widgets that live on your home or lock screens and provide everything from music playback to weather and note taking.Manufacturers such as Samsung and LG add custom "skins" on top of the core operating system, offering a unique look and feel. Better still, you can install your own launcher or add a custom theme, which makes your phone look and feel completely different — and uniquely yours.</p>

    <p>
  5. Many more hardware options, including rugged phones
At one time, Google's marketing tagline for Android was "Be Together. Not the Same." That makes sense, because the platform appears on hundreds of different phone models around the world. You can get Android phones with giant screens, small screens, modular add-ons, QWERTY keyboards and replaceable batteries.It's nice to know that the latest iPhones are water-resistant, but if you're really worried about breaking your phone, there are some truly rugged handsets out there, like the Moto Z2 Force, which has a screen that's guaranteed not to crack for four years and an optional projector add-on. You can also consider the LG X venture, which is shock-resistant from up to 4 feet in the air. If you want the feeling of typing on real physical keys, look no further than the BlackBerry KeyOne.</p>

    <p>
    6. A true, working file system
Want to copy files from your iPhone to your computer? You'll need to install iTunes and set up an account, and even then, you can move only media files, such as photos, back and forth. Plug an Android phone into your PC, on the other hand, and it instantly mounts as an external drive filled with folders you can drag and drop.With iOS 11, iPhone users recently got the ability to browse through some of their data files using the new Files app. However, Files doesn't give you access to all the folders on your device like Android tools such as Astro File Manager and ES File Manager do. And the iOS 11 Files app still doesn't make your iPhone appear as an external drive when you connect it to your computer via USB. </p>

    <p>
    7. A back button
Android's back button provides a really simple and helpful way to return to a previous screen no matter where you are. The button even works across apps. If you hit a link in Facebook and get transported to the Chrome browser, you can return to the social media app when you hit the back button.

On the iPhone, you can get contextual back buttons within apps or a back button that appears when you click a link that takes you from one app to another. However, there's no universal button that helps you step back.</p>

    <p>
    8. Multiwindow support
If you're looking to multitask on your phone, you want an Android phone. The latest two versions of Google's mobile operating system, Android 7 Nougat and Android 8 Oreo, have a built-in multiwindow mode, allowing you to, for example, look at the company web page in one window while you reply to your boss's email in another. Even without the latest OS update, phones from LG and Samsung have this split-screen view built in. Apple has a split-screen view in iOS, but only for the company's tablets, not its phones.</p>

    <p>
   9. Write with a stylus
While you can get an Apple Pencil for your iPad, if you want to scribble on your iPhone screen, you're pretty much out of luck (you can buy a capacitive stylus which is no better than your finger).However, the Galaxy Note 8 comes with the extremely powerful S Pen, and the onboard software lets you use the stylus for drawing, writing instant messages and scribbling notes even when the phone's screen is off. LG also makes a number of stylus-enabled phones, including the G4 Stylus and the Stylo 3.</p>

<p>10. More login options 
The iPhone 6, 7 and 8 all use Apple's Touch ID fingerprint recognition to let you log in with one touch, but they don't offer facial or retina recognition. The iPhone X offers facial recognition but no fingerprint or retina option. Android devices provide you with a wide range of authentication options. Samsung's recent Galaxy phones, for example, let you choose fingerprint, retina or facial recognition.</p>


    <h2>D. FAMILY SHARING</h2>

    <p>The organizer of a Family (“Organizer”) must be 18 years or older and the parent or legal guardian of any Family member under age 13 or the equivalent minimum age in their Home Country (as set forth in the registration process). Apple devices are required for access to all of the Family Sharing features.</p>

    <p>
    Purchase Sharing: Family Sharing’s Purchase Sharing feature allows you to share eligible Content among up to six members of a Family. The Organizer invites other members to participate, and agrees to pay for all Transactions initiated by Family members. The Organizer's payment method is used to pay for any Transaction initiated by a Family member (except when the Family member’s account has store credit, which is always used first). Family members are acting as agents for the Organizer when the Organizer’s payment method is used. The Organizer hereby agrees (1) to pay for such Transactions, and (2) that Transactions initiated by Family members are authorized. Organizers are responsible for complying with their payment method contract, and assume all risk related to sharing access to the payment method with Family members. A receipt or invoice for any Family member Transaction is sent to the initiating Family member and the Organizer.</p>

    <p>
    Ask to Buy: Ask to Buy is a convenient feature that allows an Organizer to approve each Transaction initiated by a Family member under age 18 (or the equivalent age of majority in your Home Country). The Organizer must be the parent or legal guardian of any Family member for whom Ask to Buy is activated. Content downloaded from Family members or acquired via redemption codes are not subject to Ask to Buy.</p>

    <p>
    Family Member changes: When a Family member leaves or is removed from the Family, the remaining Family members may no longer be able to access the former member’s Content, including Content acquired with the Organizer’s payment method.</p>

    <p>
    Family Sharing Rules: You can only belong to one Family at a time, and may join any Family no more than twice per year. You can change the Apple ID you associate with a Family no more than once every 90 days. All Family members must share the same Home Country. Not all Content, including In-App Purchases, subscriptions, and some previously acquired Apps, are eligible for Purchase Sharing. Apple Arcade and Apple News+ subscriptions are automatically enabled for Purchase Sharing. Subscriptions shared by a Family may be subject to Content usage limitations on a per subscription basis.</p>


    <h2>E. PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATION FEATURES</h2>

    <p>The Services may recommend Content to you based on your downloads, purchases and other activities. You may opt out from receiving such personalized recommendations for some Services in your account settings.</p>

    <p>
    Some recommendation features may require your permission before they are turned on. If you turn on these features, you will be asked to give Apple permission to collect and store certain data, including but not limited to data about your device activity, location, and usage. Please carefully read the information presented when you turn on these features.</p>


    <h2>F. ADDITIONAL ITUNES STORE TERMS</h2>

    <p>SEASON PASS AND MULTI-PASS</p>

    <p>
    A Pass allows you to purchase and receive television Content as it becomes available. A Season Pass applies to television Content that has a limited number of episodes per season; a Multi-Pass applies to television Content that is available on an ongoing basis. The full price of a Season Pass or Multi-Pass is charged at the time of the Transaction. Season Pass or Multi-Pass Content is available for download up to 90 days after the last episode becomes available. If automatic renewal is selected when you obtain a Multi-Pass, you will be charged the full price of each subsequent Multi-Pass cycle. You can turn off automatic renewal at least 24 hours prior to the beginning of the next Multi-Pass cycle in your account settings. If a Content provider delivers to Apple fewer TV episodes than planned when you purchased a Season Pass, we will credit to your Apple ID the retail value of the corresponding number of episodes that were not provided to Apple.</p>


    <h2>G. ADDITIONAL APP STORE TERMS (EXCLUDING APPLE ARCADE APPS)</h2>

    <h2>LICENSE OF APP STORE CONTENT</h2>

    <p>App licenses are provided to you by Apple or a third party developer (“App Provider”). If you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., the merchant of record is Apple Distribution International Ltd., which means that you acquire the App license from Apple Distribution International Ltd., but the App is licensed by the App Provider. An App licensed by Apple is an “Apple App;” an App licensed by an App Provider is a “Third Party App.” Apple acts as an agent for App Providers in providing the App Store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the App Provider. Any App that you acquire is governed by the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”) set forth below, unless Apple or the App Provider provides an overriding custom license agreement (“Custom EULA”). The App Provider of any Third Party App is solely responsible for its content, warranties, and claims that you may have related to the Third Party App. You acknowledge and agree that Apple is a third-party beneficiary of the Standard EULA or Custom EULA applicable to each Third Party App and may therefore enforce such agreement. Certain Apps, such as stickers and iMessage apps, may not appear on the device springboard but can be accessed and used in the Messages app drawer.</p>

    <h3>IN-APP PURCHASES</h3>

    <p>Apps may offer content, services or functionality for use within such Apps (“In-App Purchases”). In-App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App (for example, virtual gems) cannot be transferred among devices and can be downloaded only once. You must authenticate your account before making In-App Purchases – separate from any authentication to obtain other Content – by entering your password or using Touch ID or Face ID. You will be able to make additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without re-authenticating unless you’ve asked us to require a password for every purchase or have enabled Touch ID or Face ID. You can turn off the ability to make In-App Purchases by following these instructions: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201304.</p>

    <h3>APP MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT</h3>

    <p>Apple is responsible for providing maintenance and support for Apple Apps only, or as required under applicable law. App Providers are responsible for providing maintenance and support for Third Party Apps.</p>

    <h3>APP BUNDLES</h3>

    <p>Some Apps may be sold together as a bundle (“App Bundle”). The price displayed with an App Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing the App Bundle. The App Bundle price may be reduced to account for Apps you have already purchased or acquired, but may include a minimum charge to complete the App Bundle.</p>

    <h3>LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</h3>

    <p>Apps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to each App is subject to your prior acceptance of either this Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”), or a custom end user license agreement between you and the Application Provider (“Custom EULA”), if one is provided. Your license to any Apple App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by Apple, and your license to any Third Party App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by the Application Provider of that Third Party App. Any App that is subject to this Standard EULA is referred to herein as the “Licensed Application.” The Application Provider or Apple as applicable (“Licensor”) reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.</p>

    <p>a. Scope of License: Licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use the Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules. The terms of this Standard EULA will govern any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the Licensed Application as well as upgrades provided by Licensor that replace or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a Custom EULA. Except as provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not transfer, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application and, if you sell your Apple Device to a third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Apple Device before doing so. You may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application).</p>

    <p>
    b. Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.</p>

    <h2>H. ADDITIONAL APPLE BOOKS TERMS</h2>

    <p>You acquire Apple Books Content from the third-party provider of such Content (the “Publisher”), not Apple. Apple acts as an agent for the Publisher in providing Apple Books Content to you, and therefore Apple is not a party to the Transaction between you and the Publisher. If you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., the merchant of record is Apple Distribution International Ltd., which means that you acquire a license to use the Content from Apple Distribution International Ltd., but the Content is licensed by the Publisher. The Publisher of the Apple Books Content reserves the right to enforce the terms of use relating to such Apple Books Content. The Publisher of the Apple Books Content is solely responsible for such Content, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to such Content.</p>

    <h2>I. ADDITIONAL APPLE MUSIC TERMS</h2>

    <h3>APPLE MUSIC MEMBERSHIP</h3>

    <p>Apple Music is a subscription music service. Your Apple Music membership will automatically renew until you cancel in account settings. See the “Subscriptions” section for more details. When your Apple Music membership ends, you will lose access to any feature of Apple Music that requires a membership, including but not limited to access to Apple Music songs stored on your device, and iCloud Music Library.</p>

    <p>
    Where available, you may be offered an Apple Music membership through your wireless carrier (a “Carrier Membership”). If you purchase a Carrier Membership, your carrier will bill you for the cost of your Apple Music membership. Your billing relationship with the carrier is governed by the carrier’s terms and conditions, not this Agreement, and any billing disputes related to a Carrier Membership must be directed to your carrier, not Apple. By using Apple Music, you agree that your carrier may exchange your carrier account information, telephone number and subscription information with Apple, and that Apple may use this information to determine the status of your Carrier Membership.</p>


    <h3>ICLOUD MUSIC LIBRARY</h3>

    <p>iCloud Music Library is an Apple Music feature that allows you to access your matched or uploaded songs, playlists and music videos acquired from Apple Music, the iTunes Store or a third party (“iCloud Music Library Content”) on your Apple Music-enabled devices. iCloud Music Library is turned on automatically when you set up your Apple Music membership. iCloud Music Library collects information about your iCloud Music Library Content. This information is associated with your Apple ID, and compared to iCloud Music Library Content currently available on Apple Music. iCloud Music Library Content that is not matched is uploaded to Apple’s iCloud Music Library servers (in a format determined by Apple). You can upload up to 100,000 songs. Songs acquired from the iTunes Store or Apple Music do not count against this limit. Songs that do not meet certain criteria (for example, excessively large files) or that are not authorized for your device are not eligible for iCloud Music Library. When you use iCloud Music Library, Apple logs information such as the tracks you play, stop or skip, the devices you use, and the time and duration of playback. You agree to use iCloud Music Library only for lawfully acquired content. iCloud Music Library is provided on an “AS IS” basis and could contain errors or inaccuracies. You should back up your data and information prior to using iCloud Music Library. If you are not an Apple Music member, you may purchase an iTunes Match subscription, which is subject to the terms set forth in this section.</p>
